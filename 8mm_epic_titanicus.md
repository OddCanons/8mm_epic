# 8mm Adeptus Titanicus

## Design Note

_Titan and weapon stats are from the up-to-date version of the Epic Armageddon rules with errata applied. Where other sources or extrapolation from Adeptus Titanicus or Warhammer 40,000 are used, reference notes are included. The names of weapons have been adjusted to match the Adeptus Titanicus names. The Reaver weapons require the most extrapolation. Adeptus Titanicus introduced some smaller versions of the Warlord weapons for the Reaver and added the three-barrel Laser Blaster and two melee options._

Damage Capacity 3, Void Shields 2, Critical Hit: The Warhound is caught off balance and staggers. Move D6cm in a random direction. If this move takes the Warhound into impassable terrain or another unit it can't move over then it stops when it contacts the obstruction and suffers an extra point of damage. If it staggers into or over any unit then they will take a hit on a D6 roll of 6+; make saving throws for the units normally.

Notes: _Fearless, Reinforced Armour, Walker._ May step over units and impassable terrain or dangerous terrain that is lower than the Titan's knees and up to 2cm wide.

## Knights

> **ION SHIELDS**
>
> Imperial Knights are protected by ion shields. Ion shields are created by directional field generators that are much less sophisticated than the void shields carried by titans.
>
> Each Imperial Knight receives a special 4+ saving throw that can be taken instead of its normal saving throw. This save may always be taken against ranged attacks, even against Titan Killer or Macro-Weapon attacks. Make a separate save for each point of damage. If a vehicle with a ion shield also has reinforced armour, then it is allowed to re-roll its saving throw unless hit by Lance, Macro-Weapon, or Titan Killer attacks, but the re-roll must be made using the units armour save rather than the ion shield save. No Blast markers are placed for hits that are saved by an ion shield.
>
> Being directional, ion shields are more susceptible to crossfire than other types of protection. An ion shield save made for a unit in a crossfire is made with a -2 penalty.

> **ION SHIELD GAUNTLETS**
>
> Some Cerastus Knights are armed with ion shield gauntlets. 

## Notes

1. The Quake Cannon stats are given in the appendices (page 165) from _Epic Armageddon_.
2. The Plasma Annihilator stats are given with the Imperator Titan rules in the appendices (page 164) from _Epic Armageddon_. That weapon appears to be too big and too much better than the Plasma Blastgun in terms of range and potential damage to be right for the Warlord. Neither the Plasma Cannon nor the Plasma Destructor are close. This version is an extrapolation based on the relative attributes of the weapons in Adeptus Titanicus.
3. The difference between the Macro-Gatling Blaster and the Gatling Blaster in Adeptus Titanicus is the Strength, 7 versus 5. Given the Ordnance trait, a good way to reflect the difference between the two weapons is to make the AT one notch worse for the Gatling Blaster. The Macro-Gatling Blaster from Adeptus Titanicus was given the original Epic values, because it is the arm weapon for the Warlord.
4. The Laser Blaster stats are given in the appendices (page 165) from _Epic Armageddon_. However, as listed, they're exactly the same as the Turbo Laser Destructor. The Warhound kept the Epic Turbo Laser Destructor. In Adeptus Titanicus, the Laser Blaster gets 3 dice instead of 2 with the same strength and traits as the Turbo Laser Destructor. It seems obvious to do something similar with the Laser Blaster in Epic.
5. The Chain Fist stats are given in the appendices (page 165) from _Epic Armageddon_.
6. The Melta Cannon stats are given in the appendices (page 165) from _Epic Armageddon_.
7. At Epic scale, there's almost no difference between the two Reaver melee options. In Adeptus Titanics, one is more likely to hit. The other is more likely to cause more damage. They have the same points value. The stats for the glove have the same expected damage output as the Chainfist, but gets there with more attacks that do less damage on average.
8. The only differences between the Volcano Cannon and the Belicosa Volcano Cannon in Adeptus Titanicus are 2 points of strength and the size of the blast markers. This is represented in Epic by dropping the Titan Killer value. Doing something like dropping the MW from 2+ to 3+ would be too much of a difference. The points value of the Belicosa variant is more than double in Adeptus Titanicus, but that seems to have as much to do with the durability of the Warlord as a platform for the weapon as it does the change in strength and blast radius.
9. The Warp Missile stats are given in the appendices (page 165) from _Epic Armageddon_.
10. The Inferno Gun stats are given in the appendices (page 165) of _Epic Armageddon_.
