# 8mm Adeptus Titanicus

## Design Note

_Titan and weapon stats are from the up-to-date version of the Epic Armageddon rules with errata applied. Where other sources or extrapolation from Adeptus Titanicus or Warhammer 40,000 are used, reference notes are included. The names of weapons have been adjusted to match the Adeptus Titanicus names. The Reaver weapons require the most extrapolation. Adeptus Titanicus introduced some smaller versions of the Warlord weapons for the Reaver and added the three-barrel Laser Blaster and two melee options._

## Titans

> **VOID SHIELDS**
>
> Imperial Titans are protected by void shield generators. The number of void shields each titan has is noted on the titanâ€™s datasheet.
>
> Each void shield will automatically stop one point of damage and then go down. Do not make armour saves for damage stopped by void shields, or allocate Blast markers. Once all of the shields have been knocked down, the titan may be damaged normally and you may make saving throws against any hits that are scored. Hits from close combat ignore void shields but units using their firefight values must first knock down any shields before they can damage the Titan.
>
> Void shields that have been knocked down can be repaired. Each Titan can repair one downed void shield in the end phase of each turn. In addition, if a Titan regroups it can use the dice roll to either repair void shields or remove Blast markers (e.g. if you rolled a 2 you could repair 2 shields, remove 2 blast makers, or repair 1 shield and remove 1 Blast marker).

## Notes

1. The Mori Quake Cannon has a longer range than the Belicosa Volcano Cannon. The Concussive, Quake, and Blast attributes from Adeptus Titanicus map well to BPs, Disrupt, Ignore Cover, and the Macro-Weapon abilities in Epic. The number of BPs was selected based on the relative point values of Belicosa Volcano Cannon and the Mori Quake Cannon in Adeptus Titanicus.
2. The Sunfury Plase Annihilator is less than twice the points value of the Plasma Blastgun in Adeptus Titanicus. It has twice the dice at the same strength and range and does not have the Blast trait.
3. The difference between the Macro-Gatling Blaster and the Blaster in Adeptus Titanicus is the Strength, 7 versus 5. Given the Ordnance trait, a good way to reflect the difference between the two weapons is to make the AT one notch worse for the Gatling Blaster. The Macro-Gatling Blaster from Adeptus Titanicus was given the original Epic values, because it is the arm weapon for the Warlord.
4. The Warhound kept the Epic Turbo Laser Destructor. In Adeptus Titanicus, the Laser Blaster gets 3 dice instead of 2 with the same strength and traits as the Turbo Laser Destructor. It seems obvious to do something similiar with the Laser Blaster in Epic.
5. The Reaver Titan Chainfist in Adeptus Titanicus has less strength the the Arioch Titan Power Claw and Rending.
6. The Melta Cannon embraces the Adeptus Titanicus Fusion trait of being better at half range.
7. At Epic scale, there's almost no difference between the two Reaver melee options. In Adeptus Titanics, one is more likely to hit. The other is more likely to cause more damage. They have the same points value.
8. The only differences between the Volcano Cannon and the Belicosa Volcano Cannon in Adeptus Titanicus are 2 points of strength and the size of the blast markers. This is represented in Epic by dropping the Titan Killer value. Doing something like dropping the MW from 2+ to 3+ would be too much of a difference. The points value of the Belicosa variant is more than double in Adeptus Titanicus, but that seems to have as much to do with the durability of the Warlord as a platform for the weapon as it does the change in strength and blast radius.
9. The Warp Missile uses the Deathstrike Missile rules from _Epic Armageddon_.
10. The Inferno Gun stats are given with the Lucius Pattern Warhound Titan in the appendices (page 164) of _Epic Armageddon_.
