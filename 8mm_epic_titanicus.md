# 8mm Adeptus Titanicus

## Design Note

_Titan and weapon stats are from the up-to-date version of the Epic Armageddon rules with errata applied. Where other sources or extrapolation from Adeptus Titanicus or Warhammer 40,000 are used, reference notes are included. The names of weapons have been adjusted to match the Adeptus Titanicus names._

## Titans

> **VOID SHIELDS**
>
> Imperial Titans are protected by void shield generators. The number of void shields each titan has is noted on the titanâ€™s datasheet.
>
> Each void shield will automatically stop one point of damage and then go down. Do not make armour saves for damage stopped by void shields, or allocate Blast markers. Once all of the shields have been knocked down, the titan may be damaged normally and you may make saving throws against any hits that are scored. Hits from close combat ignore void shields but units using their firefight
values must first knock down any shields before they can damage the Titan.
>
> Void shields that have been knocked down can be repaired. Each Titan can repair one downed void shield in the end phase of each turn. In addition, if a Titan regroups it can use the dice roll to either repair void shields or remove Blast markers (e.g. if you rolled a 2 you could repair 2 shields, remove
2 blast makers, or repair 1 shield and remove 1 Blast marker).

## Notes

1. The Mori Quake Cannon has a longer range than the Belicosa Volcano Cannon. The Concussive, Quake, and Blast attributes from Adeptus Titanicus map well to BPs, Disrupt, Ignore Cover, and the Macro-Weapon abilities in Epic. The number of BPs was selected based on the relative point values of Belicosa Volcano Cannon and the Mori Quake Cannon.
