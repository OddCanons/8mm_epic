# 8mm Epic Rules

These modifications are intended to bring standard Epic Armageddon rules, as captured and clarified in the (Epic-UK rules)[http://epic-uk.co.uk/wp/rules/], up to 8mm scale and to include any new features of the models available, including Terrain and elements like defensive weapons on Titans. 

> **A note on scale**: Games Workshop's models tend toward a "heroic" scale and the Epic models were roughly 6mm scale with significant variation in practical scale. The Epic-UK approach to this has been to include [rules for the new Adeptus Titanicus: Horus Heresy models](http://epic-uk.co.uk/lists/CodexAT.pdf) as if they were already in scale with other Epic models. This approach is fine. The choice in these rules is to go with the 8mm scale as being a step up from the 6mm scale.

## Distances

Multiply all distances by 1 1/3, rounding to the nearest 5cm. Most Epic distances, particularly weapon ranges, divide evenly by 3. For the few that don't, there's a simple table below. For any distances less than 5cm, add +1cm rather than multiplying by 1 1/3. For example, a Warlord Titan can step over terrain that is up to _3cm_ wide in 8mm scale. From 5cm to 9cm, add 2cm.

6mm | -> | 8mm | | | 6mm | -> | 8mm
--- | -- | --- | - | - | -- | -- | ---
2-5cm | | +1cm | | | | | 
5-9cm | | +2cm | | | 65cm | | 85cm
10cm | | 15cm | | | 70cm | | 95cm
15cm | | 20cm | | | 75cm | | 100cm
20cm | | 25cm | | | 80cm | | 105cm
25cm | | 35cm | | | 85cm | | 115cm
30cm | | 40cm | | | 90cm | | 120cm
35cm | | 45cm | | | 95cm | | 125cm
40cm | | 55cm | | | 100cm | | 135cm
45cm | | 60cm | | | 105cm | | 140cm
50cm | | 65cm | | | 110cm | | 145cm
55cm | | 75cm | | | 115cm | | 155cm
60cm | | 80cm | | | 120cm | | 160cm

This rule applies to distances provided in the accompanying unit rules which are left at 6mm scale for ease of comparison with other units.

## Blast Markers and Templates

Epic Armageddon uses a Blast template that is 7.4cm or 3 inches in diameter and an Ordnance template that is (roughly) 12cm or 5 inches in diameter.

For 8mm Epic, use a 10cm (or 4 inch) diameter Blast template and a 16cm (6.3 inches) diameter Ordnance template. _The larger of the blue Adeptus Titanicus and older green Warhammer 40,000 blast templates, have a ring at 10cm._

## Specific Units

### Imperial Titans and Knights

These rules fully replace the Epic-UK Adeptus Titanicus titan and knight rules. The Epic-UK rules create differences where they are indicated by neither the Epic Armageddon rules nor Adeptus Titanicus, as with the _Scout_ Turbo Laser Destructor, and ignore differences where they should exist, as with the Gatling Blaster versus the Macro-Gatling Blaster. 8mm Epic goes back to the updated Epic Armageddon rules and extrapolates from them using the relative capabilities of the Adeptus Titanicus weapons and models.

### 8mm Air Support

These rules add to the air forces in the Epic-UK army rules for the aircraft from Aeronautica Imperialis.

### 8mm Conversions

Eldar Wraithlords and Wraithguard, with their lack of scale-specific features, make excellent starting points for conversions to 8mm Revenant Titans and Eldar knights, respectively. There are also some Ork models that make for good conversions at this scale.

### Other Models

If you're already converting or printing models for 8mm play, there are some great heroic-scale Forge World models to add to the 8mm fun.

## Terrain

The releases of Adeptus Titanicus and Aeronautica Imperialis have come with a wide range of terrain features from Games Workshop and Forge World.
