# 8mm Epic odd canon

With the releases of new versions of [Adeptus Titanicus](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Adeptus-Titanicus-Core-Game-EN-2020) in 2018 and [Aeronautica Imperialis](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Aeronautica-Imperialis-Wings-of-Vengenace) in 2019, Games Workshop has produced brilliantly detailed miniatures in the "new Epic" (roughly) 8mm scale. While Adeptus Titanicus and Aeronautica Imperialis are good games in their own rights, the new models present an opportunity to play Epic games in this new scale. There are many options for filling out armies with 8mm models, but these rules can also be used to make for much larger clashes of titans, knights, and any support they might have.

## Epic Gaming

The last official set of rules for 6mm Epic gaming in the Warhammer 40,000 universe was released in 2003 as _Epic Armageddon_ with the _Epic Swordwind_ expansion released the following year. The last official FAQ and errata for these rules were issued in 2009. For a time, Games Workshop made the rules available to download from its web site. Since Games Workshop stopped supporting the rules set, communities of gamers have come together to support different variations of the Epic Armageddon rules:

* [Epic-UK](http://epic-uk.co.uk/wp/)
    * [Rules](http://epic-uk.co.uk/wp/rules/)
    * [Army Lists](http://epic-uk.co.uk/wp/army-lists/)
* [NetEpic](https://netepic.org/)
    * [Rules](https://netepic.org/core-rules/)
    * [Army Lists](https://netepic.org/army-books/)
